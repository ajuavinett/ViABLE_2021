## ViABLE Meeting 2021

Tutorial notebook and slides for the workshop "Learning how to code with open access neurobiology datasets "

### There are two different ways you can run the Tutorial.ipynb notebook from your browser:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ajuavinett/ViABLE_2021.git/master?filepath=Tutorial.ipynb)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/ajuavinett/ViABLE_2021/)


### There are several ways to implement these notebooks in your class:
- Run notebooks via Binder or Colab, as demonstrated above
- Set up a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation-guide-hard.html) for your course or university (e.g., the [UCSD DataHub](http://datahub.ucsd.edu))
- Ask students to download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python, which includes Jupyter Notebook, many useful packages and more, to run these notebooks locally
